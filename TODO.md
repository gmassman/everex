ToDo
====

-   Mock the Thrift calls for unit testing
-   Add separate integration tests?
-   Add calls to get / set application data on notes
-   Bang (!) equivalents for most actions, that will return just the response
    instead of {:ok, <response>}, and raise exceptions on errors
-   Set up at least basic logging
-   Consider wrapping EDAM results in maps
